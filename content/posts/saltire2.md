These past two weeks at Boat Rocker have been good, and I have bonded more with the people on my team.
As I mentioned in my previous post, working towards getting an internship with Entrepreneurial Scotland and facing the job interview for Boat Rocker was a tough journey. However, since the very beginning, I had goals I wanted to achieve both personally and professionally.
My primary goal professionally is to do an outstanding job and go back to Edinburgh having left a good impression. You never know, I might come back. 
To leave a positive impact, I want to make sure I'm trusted with responsibilities and show that I can take on projects I have never worked on before and run with it. I also aim, at the end of this working experience, to have done anything I could have to demonstrate my value and that I can exceed expectations even in a limited amount of time.
On the other hand, from a personal perspective, I seek for better confidence in myself. It's vital to learn what I can do, and don't be sceptical of my abilities. There are a lot of things I can be afraid of, but very few I should genuinely be worried about.  Handling stress and anxious moments in new environments are two of the aspects I should expect, and learn to embrace them. To any current or future Saltire Scholars; new surroundings come with a lot of uncertainties, and it can be easy to feel overwhelmed, but focusing on the task, asking questions and create a system that works for you, it's critical.

I can say that my first two weeks on the job have made me realised how much I had no reason to worry. During the leadership day, lots of other Scholars had voiced the same concern: "What if I don't live up to the expectations?"
I and so many others were fairly concerned about this, and I believe it comes from the desire to do well and not fall behind. I unreasonably expected to be asked things out of this world. I knew I would have been able to figure it out if that would have been the case, but it wasn't. I'm competent to do all the work assigned to me, and the workplace has exceeded my expectations. It's a very relaxed environment, where everyone is always working very hard, but there is still time for a cup of coffee, a chat or lunch together.
I have been working in a professional environment with a considerable amount of responsibilities for the past three years already. The hospitality industry is very different, very straining both mentally and physically.
Working in an office is hugely different and challenging in different ways. The environment is not fast-paced, but deadlines are still present, and it's essential to have a plan and stick to it. I think that's something I was able to translate from my part-time job in Edinburgh to this new position as an intern in Toronto.
I found myself comfortable in working towards weekly goals and sticking to deadlines. So far I have never felt like I wasn't capable, and the support provided is always outstanding. I'm so used to people being short and figure things out while on the job, so it has been refreshing to have more time to grasp a task and receive support whenever I needed it.

In the past few days, I've worked on the company database, and I have also worked on some learning projects on Adobe Photoshop, as well as, helping out the Communications team. Indeed, the Canadian Screen Awards are getting closer, and it's necessary to have a clear view of all requirements, rules and timing for submission, and what the production studios are going to put forward, and in what way. I have worked on a couple of documents that make the whole process more straightforward and understandable so that we'll be able to receive the right information and files from different parts of the company and avoid miscommunications. I'm going to be working some more with the Communications team in the following days/weeks, so I hope to be sharing more insights into that.

Outside of work, I have been busy with a few different things.

Two weeks ago I ventured to Missisagua, where the other two Saltire Scholars (Layla & Silviya) are staying, and we finally watched the Incredibles 2, which was hilarious. I heard a lot of different opinions about it, but I genuinely loved it.
Last Friday, my flatmate Kate and I joined Layla's neighbours and her at Snakes & Lattes, where we had dinner and played board games. There must be a similar place in Edinburgh! I had so much fun, mainly because we were such a large group of people. I got to showcase my extensive knowledge of Harry Potter with Trivial Pursuit, so it was a good evening.
On the following day, Kate, Geunyoung and I went to Pizza Fest. Pizza is everything! Food and the music were great.
I also got a chance to go to the Boat Rocker Summer Bash, the following Thursday, which was set in the new space, where parts of the company will be moving into next year. I wish I could see it in person when it's all refurbished a functional, but I think I'll have to settle for the pictures. Boat Rocker is growing!
I'll be coming back with a new post very soon; I'm trying to catch up!
