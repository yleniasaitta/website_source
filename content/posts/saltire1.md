Finally, I get to write my **first blog post**. Two weeks have passed since I got to Toronto and so far it has been lovely, thanks to my flatmates, the Torontonians I've met, *Layla & Silviya* (Saltire Scholars in Mississauga) and of course the team at Boat Rocker Media. I already know it's going to be even better in the weeks to come.

In these two photos below you can see my friend and flatmate *Geun-young*, from *South Korea*. She's super photogenic, and our visit to **Casa Loma** was a perfect chance for a photo shoot. I can confirm she has permitted me to upload these picture.

I spent the first week getting to know the city and my way around, while waiting for my work permit approval to come through. The four weeks after I sent off my permit application have been quite stressful. It has been easy to feel frustrated, and a bit lost while organising everything before leaving Edinburgh and after arriving in Canada but unable to start my internship. Getting to know the city and my flatmates has kept me busy, and in a matter of days Toronto reminded me of London or Milan, so nothing I was not accustomed to. It feels like home already, and I settled in quickly, even though I still had a lot of uncertainties about my permit.
However, on Monday this week my work permit was approved and, Layla and I, adventured to Niagara Falls over the Rainbow Bridge to reach the US. We could only obtain the work permit after briefly stepping into the US, and even though it took a little longer than expected, we made it!

I have started my internship at **Boat Rocker Media** this past Wednesday, as a *Media Intern* in their *Rights department*. Boat Rocker is a Media company that helps to manage and sell the work of different production studios to broadcasters around the world. One of their most famous tv series is *Orphan Black*, which was produced by Temple Street Productions and BBC America. Boat Rocker works on lots of different shows for adults, teenagers and kids, from factual to scripted.

I have only been working for three days, and I cannot wait to go back on Monday. From the HR manager, the Rights team manager, to all of my coworkers in the Rights Department and the bigger Boat Rocker Media team, everyone has been nothing but lovely, approachable and hardworking. I felt immediately accepted and trusted with the work. I feel empowered to bring my input and do a great job every day. I'm the first intern to be working in the rights department, and I understand how the position can seem far away from my Media degree, but it matches perfectly my passion for television, my meticulous attention to detail and the organisation freak that lives in me.
Throughout my time at Boat Rocker, I will continuously be working on the company database to update and organise data regarding the company intellectual properties. At the same time, I'll also take part in meetings with the Sales and the Marketing Teams, with whom I'll be introduced to a more creative side of the rights department, to which I very much look forward.

Lots of the stress and frustration I had accumulated had been swept away like dust in a matter of moments, as soon as the Canadian Border Officer handed me my work permit. 
I could finally start working on my internship, and all the hard work since October 2017 had come to a climax. I honestly felt a Saltire Intern at that point. Working on improving my CVs and stepping up my game on my Cover Letter structure has been invaluable. 
Colin, my career advisor at Queen Margaret University, has offered me so much help at the beginning of my application process and Katie, a GSK Saltire Scholar 2017 has been the most kind-hearted spirit I have met along this journey. She helped me to understand and channel all my skills and experiences to showcase myself at
my best, rather than to burn away my chances of getting an internship because of being stuck in what I thought was the right way to prepare for an interview.
I've always known what it would have meant to be a Saltire Scholar for me. However, when indeed finalised, it all became more evident. 
Be part of the Saltire Programme and receive this significant opportunity from Entrepreneurial Scotland means the world. It will sound like the most cheesy thing you have ever read, but some things just have got to be said. 

I come from a tiny town in Italy, and I'm the first person in my family to go to University. I started to learn English about seven years ago, and I became confident and fluent just five years ago. I had people telling me my English was so terrible I could have never even hoped to study in the UK, especially for a Media degree. It hurt to have very little support, but as you can tell, I didn't let it go. I sought help, and I put in the work. I'm most definitely not a straight-A student like I'd like to be. I didn't always believe I could reach my goals, but I did it anyway.
I know it's a very soppy story, but I never said it would have been a cringe-free blog post. Being a Saltire Scholar means I can better myself, learn to trust in my skills and join an enormous group of like-minded people, who cannot wait around and hope that opportunities will come their way. We all go and seek it. I have met the most diverse characters while at the Leadership Day in Glasgow, a little over a month ago. It's really for everyone who is serious about their future and is ready to take up this chance. Even if you don't obtain an internship, the whole journey is such a learning experience, from which you'll come out different.

I would have never thought my experience would have been this amazing already, but it has exceeded my expectations. I cannot wait to see what's to come and strangely I'm ready for all the challenges that will come my way. I know this will be one of the best summers I have had, and I hope I won't be defeated and that my morale will keep being this high.
See you next week or maybe in a couple of weeks, who knows? For another update. Less cheesy (hopefully).
